# Project 2 Analysis

## Introduction

As someone whoâ€™s been on the job search myself, I was surprised by how little data exists on the best roles and skills in the data science market. This gap motivated me to analyze what skills top employers seek and how these skills impact salary potential.

### Questions to Analyze

In exploring the data science job market, I focused on these questions:

1. **Do more skills lead to better pay?**
2. **What are the salary ranges for data jobs in various regions?**
3. **Which skills are most in-demand for data professionals?**
4. **How much are the top 10 skills compensated?**

### Excel Skills Used

For this analysis, I applied several Excel skills essential to data processing and visualization:

- **Pivot Tables**
- **Pivot Charts**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Power Query**
- **Power Pivot**

### Data Jobs Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains 2023 data science job information and is sourced from
[Luke Barousse's collection, available here](Datasets). It includes detailed data on:

It includes detailed information on:

- **Job titles**

    - The first query contains all job information.
    - The second lists skills associated with each job ID.
