# Excel_Project_data-job
Hi! I'm a final-year Economics student actively seeking internship opportunities. Over the past months, I've been sharpening my Excel and data skills by watching tutorials on YouTube and LinkedIn Learning. Now, I want to showcase my practical abilities through this project, as I believe that simply collecting LinkedIn certificates may not be enough for hiring managers to fully appreciate my skills :).

In this project, I’ve completed two key components: a Salary Dashboard and a Salary Analysis.

[All data used in this project is sourced from Luke Barousse's collection; and is also stored here!](Datasets)

## 1. Salary Dashboard

My goal with this project is to give both job-seekers and myself a clearer understanding of salary trends and market expectations within data roles—skills and insights that are valuable as I enter the job market.

## 2. Salary Analysis

By analyzing the most in-demand skills and top-paying roles, I’m aiming to fill a gap in data science career resources, providing insights for job-seekers looking to understand and negotiate their value.

This analysis aims to clarify which skills top employers prioritize, providing valuable insights for anyone, like myself, aspiring to secure well-compensated roles in data-focused careers.
